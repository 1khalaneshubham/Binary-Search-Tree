# Binary-Search-Tree
Definition. A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where every node in the left subtree is less than the root, and every node in the right subtree is of a value greater than the root. The properties of a binary search tree are recursive: if we consider any node as a “root,” these properties will remain true.
